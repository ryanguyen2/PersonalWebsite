                            I am a student in grade 10 that currently attends Ancaster High School.
                            In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, watching movies, and hanging out with friends.
                            I am interested in entrepreneuship and coding. I am still young however, so the career that best 
                            suits me is still yet to be decided.
                            In the future, I would like to have an impact on this world. Whether that'd be helping others,
                            donating to charities, and so on; I want to have an impact on the people around me. I also hope
                            to travel to a variety of countries in the future and spend time with those I love.

                            This was my first ever published project, and the process to make this website was fun and educational,
                            but at times, led to problems and frustration which required me to problem solve and learn more about HTML and CSS along the way.
                            Overall this project was extremly beneficial to me, as I was able to learn a lot about web-devolpment.

                            College. My partners and I came up with a service called FormFixer; an app that critically gives an in-depth 
                            analysis of an individuals form when working out. By tracking the user's body position, speed, and angles at which they
                            perform the movement, they will recieve analytical data that will have the purpose of preventing 
                            injuries when exercising. Unfortunately, my group did not succeed in advancing to become one of the finalists, however, I was able to learn more 
                            about how to make a business plan, the financial aspect of a start up, and so on.
